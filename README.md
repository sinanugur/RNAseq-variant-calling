# sncRNA workflow
[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#active) 

A small ncRNA workflow in Snakemake.



Installation
------------
To install this workflow, clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/sinanugur/sncRNA-workflow.git
cd sncRNA-workflow

```

Quick start example
-------------------
Create a new directory called __data__ and place your FASTQ files or their symbolic links into `data/` directory. You need an active Conda installation with Snakemake. You do not have to install any other requirements. This will trigger a workflow run immediately using 15 threads:

```
snakemake -j 15 --use-conda
```

Databases
---------------------
```
GENCODE (v38)
miRBase (v22)
piRBase (v1.0)
```

Output
------
This workflow will generate `results/` directory. 

This directory contains count tables and sample statistics.

```
Full GENCODE count table: gencode.tsv
miRBase miRNA: miRNA.tsv
miRBase miRNA precursor: miRNA_precursor.tsv
long non-coding RNA (GENCODE): lincRNA.tsv
miscellaneous RNA (GENCODE): misc_RNA.tsv
piwi-interacting RNAs (piRBase): piRNA.tsv
mRNA (GENCODE): protein_coding.tsv
Small nucleolar RNA (GENCODE): snoRNA.tsv
Small nuclear RNA (GENCODE): snRNA.tsv
Small Cajal body-specific RNA (GENCODE): scaRNA.tsv
tRNA (GENCODE): tRNA.tsv
antisense RNA: antisense.tsv

```
